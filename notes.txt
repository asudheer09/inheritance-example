Inheritance is also called is -a relationship.
By using extends keyword we can implement inheritance.
The main advantage is code re-usability.

Method overloading:
 writing multiple methods with same name but different arguments with in the same class.

Method overriding:
rewriting parent class method into the child class.

Rules for method overloading:
1. method name and arguments should match while overriding.
2. private methods and static methods are not allowed to override.

Difference:
Property                Method Overloading                  method overriding
==============================================================================
1. Method names :           same                                same
2. arguments                different                           same
3. signature                different                           same
4. return types             different                           co-variant ( u can replace return type with child)
5. private/final/static     can be overload                     cant override.
6. example for              compile time polymorphism           runtime polymorphism
7. also                     static polymorphism                 dynamic polymorphism
